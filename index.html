  <p>While our time together is limited, I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t at least make a plug for the importance of having a basic understanding of HTML/CSS. Even if we were to exclusively use the most sophisticated platforms and stunning drag-and-drop interfaces, I would still argue that even a cursory foundation in HTML and CSS is useful (possibly essential) for humans who regularly interact with web content and care to think critically about texts.</p>
  
  <h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h3>
  
  <p>Brief fundamentals with the help of <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/overview-of-css-concepts/#html-fundamentals">this excellent guide by Tania Rascia</a>.</p>
  
  <h3 id="whatismarkdown">What is Markdown?</h3>
  
  <p>After all that, navigating this and other GitHub repositories, you may notice a conspicuous absence of HTML/CSS! What gives?</p>
  
  <p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@jaynel/markdown-summary">Markdown is a simplified standard for creating basic HTML content.</a> It also happens to be interoperable with an astonishing array of software. For starters, one can create web content (like the one you are reading) or write articles, generate PDFs or even slide decks.</p>
  
  <p>Among other things, it is the de facto standard for GitHub and GitHub Pages (which, for completeness sake, relies on something called Jekyll).</p>
  
  <p>Imagine for a moment attempting to write your next article in HTML. Everytime you added a paragraph or a new section, you would need to open and close a paragraph tag. You would need wrap every footnote and quote and caption in highly-specialized markup. And if you missed a character or misspelled a tag, the whole thing might fall apart. Not ideal.</p>
  
  <p>To split the difference between the human legibility of composing in a word processor (i.e., Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text">the interoperability of plain text</a>, many have adopted something called Markdown.</p>
  
  <p>Who uses Markdown? Programmers, scholars, publishers, artists, maintainers, among others. It is unusually well-adopted across very different communities of practice.</p>
  
  <h2 id="furtherresources">Further Resources</h2>
  
  <p>The internet is rife with tutorials and demos about, well, the internet. Not all are awesome, beware! When in doubt, MDN (Mozilla Developers Network) is always a good source. Included below are a few other suggestions.</p>
